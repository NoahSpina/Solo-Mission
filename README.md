This game is a remake of Space Invaders followed along "Matt Heaney Apps" on youtube. I personally expanded on the game by added an Upgrades, Ship, and Statistics Screen.

The following image is the starting screen for the app. You can either start the game, view your statistics, change your ship, or upgrade. It also displays the current ship that you have equipped.

Below is the statistics screen of the app. It keeps track of many statistics of the game and updates them the more you play.

Below is the upgrades screen. To buy an upgrade, you use money which is equal to $1 per enemy killed. This increases with the amount of times that the money upgrade is purchased.

Below is the ship buying screen. This screen uses your money to buy new and more aesthetic ships to play. Hitboxes also change.

Below is in the game. Enemies spawn from random portions of the top of the screen and come down. For every level, the enemies increase their spawning quantity linearly.

Finally, if you manage to defeat 250 enemies, you will win and the win screen will play.
